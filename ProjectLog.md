### Windows App to add a watermark date to graphic files

Useful for screen shots that have no dates

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) - Microsoft version of old Flash for native Windows apps.
Plus C# is used.
Copilot A.I. created an image service, a PowerShell sample image generator (saves lots of time).

The WPF App itself has drag and drop (list box on left). 
Visual Studio Code and then Visual Studio 2022 Community used to build.
VS 2022 fixed bugs that VS Code could not fix.
Some duplicate issues.

Amazing things about Copilot A.I. - new for this project:
* The check-in comments can be A.I. generated.
* Visual Studio 2022 has a different interface for GitHub Copilot - but those who used this IDE should like it.
* Copilot A.I. was able to generate graphics calls. The PowerShell ones are easier and pre-built cmdlets.
* The A.I. features are still a bit clumsy - e.g. you have to let current file finish with changes before clicking somewhere else.
